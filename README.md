This is my take on creating a weather app, it's obviously bad, especially on the visual side because I wouldn't say I like CSS and I couldn't be bothered to write it, but it works and that's what matters, the JS code isn't that good either, because I have been coding for no more than a month.

dependencies:
1 - Leaflet maps
2 - Chart.js
3 - VisualCrossingWeather API
